# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
- [x] Pull data from an external source - First I scrape URLs from a list of all upcoming concerts, then I scrape each concert page as a user scrolls through the CLI's pages
- [x] Implement both list and detail views - Each CLI "page" creates and lists 5 concert objects (and just displays concert title and date). By entering a concert's number, a user can view more information about that particular concert.
